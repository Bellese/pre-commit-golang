# Contributing

The following conventions are enforced with Github Actions. If you do not follow them, your contributions may not be merged back into the project.

## Commit Messages

Commit messages should follow the [Conventional Commits Standard](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#specification). We recommend installing [Commitizen](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/) - as it simplifies the process of creating compliant commit messages.

## Pre-commit Hooks

We also maintain [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) hooks that will execute code style and quality checks automatically when you commit.
